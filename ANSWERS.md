## Questions

1. What is the difference between `new` and `create` for a model?

For 'create' you have to specify all the parameters upfront, while with 'new' you can specify them one at a time, then 'save' when done.

2. What command followed after with `Cat.new` will emulate the same behavior as `Cat.create`?

'Cat.save'

This homework was around the same as previous homeworks. I like the option of having less or more guidance.
